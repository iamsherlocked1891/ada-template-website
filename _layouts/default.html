        In November 2019, the world heard the word CORONAVIRUS, which a few months later 
        became COVID-19. This disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which was first
         discovered in China. From that moment on, the spread of this virus continued 
         to increase. Indeed, the pandemic spread from country to country, and is now
          present almost everywhere. Millions of people have been infected and over 
          four hundred thousand have died!
    </p>
    <p>
        The pandemic and its rapid spread caused fear worldwide. Sanitary measures and 
        other restrictions were quickly put in place in many countries. Among the decisions 
        taken by government leaders, those relating to individual movement were the most
         significant. During lockdowns, individuals became confined to their homes, and
          schools, nurseries, universities, canteens, restaurants, shops (except essential ones), etc., were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, we ask the following question: did the implementation of these 
        restrictions impact political sentiment? How has political sentiment changed 
        over the course of the pandemic?
    </p>
    <p>
        In this context, it is natural to wonder whether an alignment between political
         decisions and people's behaviour has been achieved. Have people felt that their
          leaders need to be more in touch with their concerns and are unable to address 
          the challenges at hand effectively? Has the COVID-19 pandemic, with its 
          restrictions on daily life, sparked a renewed interest in politics among the 
          population? As we examine this dynamic, it is also important to consider the
           role of the leading political party. Have they received support from the
            population, or have they faced disapproval for their actions or lack thereof?

    <h2>Is there alignment between political decisions and people's behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic?</h2>
    <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented restrictions on mobility, forcing people to stay at home
         and go out only when necessary. But as the population adjusted to this new reality, a question 
         lingered in the minds of many: who decided to reduce mobility? Was it the government responding 
         to the crisis to slow the spread of the virus? Or were there other forces at play, shaping the
          decisions being made and dictating the course of the pandemic? The mobility data reveals an 
          influence between the governments of European countries managing the crisis and their populations
           regarding reduced mobility. How European governments and populations responded to the COVID-19 crisis had a noticeable impact on mobility behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
        The graph below depicts the changes in mobility over time (don't forget to slide!).

    <p>
        When the first deaths from COVID-19 occurred in countries such as France, Spain, and Norway, 
        there was little change in mobility. This may be because COVID-19 was still relatively unknown in Europe then. 
        However, as the virus spread more widely and began causing more deaths, particularly in countries like Italy, 
        the interest in COVID-19 increased. This was reflected in the evolution of COVID-related pageviews over time. 
        In Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Sweden, the first deaths were accompanied by reduced mobility and increased 
        interest in COVID-19. In Denmark and Finland, where the first deaths occurred later, and events had already 
        influenced the interest in COVID-19 in other countries, the increased interest in the virus likely explained the 
        reduction in mobility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding what governments did concerning mobility behaviour, lockdown measures were often implemented once the 
        decline in mobility had stabilised. This suggests that the government's restrictions on mobility came after the 
        population had already decided to reduce their mobility. This may reflect a need for governments to be more 
        responsive to the needs and concerns of their citizens. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, governments worldwide faced the daunting task of trying to ease 
        the burden on hospitals and protect their populations. To this end, many governments implemented various measures, 
        including confinement, school closures, and mask mandates.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as the crisis wore on, it became clear that not all countries were acting similarly. Some countries were
         more aggressive in their efforts to control the spread of the virus, while others were laxer in their approach. 
         This raised the question: are there countries that acted similarly, or were they taking a unique approach to the crisis?
    </p>
   
</section>
<section id="grouping">
    <h2> Is it possible to group countries based on their reaction time to the crisis? </h2>
    <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a wide range of differences in how countries have responded to the crisis. 
        By analysing each country's reaction time – the length of time it took for the first measures to be imposed 
        after the first case was detected – and the duration of mobility restrictions, we can try to group countries 
        into clusters based on their response to the pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
        One group of countries that stands out is the "big European economies" – France, Germany, and Italy– which
         took a long time to react to COVID-19 and ended up imposing long periods of reduced mobility. These countries 
         may have hesitated to take drastic measures due to concerns about the economy or the challenges of enforcing 
         measures over a large population.
         On the other hand, we see smaller, highly developed European countries like Denmark, 
        Netherlands, and Norway, which reacted quickly to COVID-19 and had shorter periods of reduced mobility.
        Another group of countries, including Finland, Japan, and Sweden, took longer to respond to the crisis 
        but imposed shorter periods of reduced mobility.
        Finally, some countries like Serbia and South Korea had relatively short periods of reduced mobility compared to other countries.
    </p>
    <p>The graph illustrates the grouping of countries based on their reaction time and duration of reduced mobility.</p>
    <img class="plot--img" src="/ada-template-website/assets/img/redused_Mobility_VS_Response_Time.png" alt="Mobility">
    <p>
        Spain is an outlier in this analysis, as it took a longer-than-average time to react to the crisis and has an
         undefined duration of reduced mobility, as there had not yet been an exact date for the return to normal levels.
          It seems likely that Spain's reduced mobility period was lengthy, similar to the other countries in group
           1 – the “big European economies” of France, Germany, and Italy – which also had long response times and 
           extended periods of reduced mobility. We thus assume that Spain is part of group 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the different groups of European countries in mind, it is worth examining how the COVID-19 pandemic 
        and the decisions made in response to it have affected people's interest in politics. Have the restrictions
         on daily life and the measures taken to address the crisis sparked a renewed interest in political engagement 
         among the population, or have they led to disengagement and disillusionment with the political process? By
          exploring these questions, we can gain a better understanding of how the pandemic has shaped people's 
          attitudes towards politics and the role it plays in their lives.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="pageviews">
    <h2>Has the COVID-19 pandemic increased people's interest in politics?</h2>
    <p>
        The Coronawiki dataset provides pageview data for various topics on Wikipedia over time, allowing us
         to track the evolution of interest in COVID-19 and politics during the pandemic. By examining the number
          of page views for these topics, we can gauge the level of interest and see how different stages of the 
          pandemic have impacted it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For four major European countries, we see that the rapid growth in interest in COVID-19 occurred 
        around the time the first case of the virus was discovered in the country. This growth is steepest 
        at the time of the first death or shortly thereafter, indicating that the news of mortality was a major 
        driving force for increased interest. We also observe a peak in interest in COVID-19 in all four countries
         shortly after the beginning of abnormal mobility, coinciding with the implementation of lockdowns and other
          strict measures. As people's lives were disrupted and they had to adapt to a new way of living, interest in
           COVID-19 peaked.
    </p>
    <p>There appeared to be no direct effect on the interest in politics when COVID-19 first appeared in these countries.
         However, we see a rise in interest in politics when mobility becomes abnormal, coinciding with significant decisions 
         taken by governments to impose measures on the population. In addition, as people's mobility is affected, they may 
         have more time to read up on politics, increasing political interest and awareness.

    <p>
        In smaller European countries that reacted quickly to COVID-19, we see a different trend in interest in COVID-19. 
        The explosive growth in interest begins before there are even any cases of the virus in the country, which may be 
        due to these countries closely monitoring the situation in the major European countries and being concerned about 
        COVID-19 before it appeared in their own country. As a result, their governments quickly addressed citizens' concerns.
         These countries also show similar trends in interest in politics, with the first cases corresponding to the beginning 
         of a rise in interest. However, unlike in the major European countries, interest in politics falls soon after mobility
          returns to normal.

    <p>
        In the countries of group 3, measures to address COVID-19 were implemented relatively late after the virus arrived. 
        Unlike the other two groups, the exponential growth in interest in COVID-19 had not yet begun when the first cases were
         discovered. The explosion in interest occurred roughly a week later in Finland, but in Sweden, it occurred approximately
          a month later, once mobility had begun to be affected. Sweden initially had very lax restrictions during the pandemic, 
          and interest in COVID-19 did not initially surge. People only became interested in COVID-19 when restrictions started to
           impact their lives.

    <p>
        The arrival of COVID-19 did not significantly affect interest in politics in these countries, although some may have objected 
        to the government's slow response. However, the populations in these countries were generally pleased with the initial response,
         as the ruling parties saw a boost in popularity. Interest in politics rose as measures were implemented and mobility became 
         affected, but it quickly fell once mobility returned to normal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we have examined how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected interest in politics and how different countries responded 
        to the crisis, we can turn to whether the population tended to support or disapprove of the leading political parties during 
        this time. To answer this question, we can use polling data to see how people's views on the parties changed throughout the 
        pandemic. This will help us understand whether the decisions made by the government were met with approval or backlash and
         how these views may have been influenced by the impact of the pandemic on people's lives and the measures taken to address it.

<section id="opinions">
    <h2>How did people's opinions of political parties change in response to COVID-19 interventions?</h2>
    <p>
        As we look at how the COVID-19 pandemic affected political opinions in different countries, we see 
        that the populations in <span>group 1</span> (large economies) had varied reactions. In Germany, there was a sharp
         rise in popularity for the ruling party, which may indicate support for their efforts to maintain 
         stability and implement sanitary measures. In Spain, the main opposition party saw an increase in 
         popularity. In Italy, a continual decrease in support for the main party in government began before
          the pandemic, suggesting that domestic issues were more influential on the party's popularity than the pandemic itself.

        In contrast, the populations in group 2 (smaller countries where the government reacted quickly) all experienced sharp 
        increases in support for the government. In Norway, the ruling party's steady decrease in popularity was almost entirely 
        reversed, indicating that the population highly valued stability and appreciated the quick response of their government.

    <p>
        To confirm this hypothesis, we conducted t-tests to see if there were statistically significant differences in the
         polling of ruling parties before and after the start of the pandemic in the smaller countries. We found statistically 
         significant differences in the polling of the main ruling parties immediately before and after the pandemic's start.
          This allows us to reject the null hypothesis that no such difference exists.

        In times of crisis, it is common for people to rally around their leaders and offer support as they navigate the challenges. 
        This is often due to a desire for stability and a belief that the government is best equipped to handle the crisis. In such 
        times, people may be more forgiving of any mistakes or missteps previously made by the government, as they understand that 
        addressing a crisis is not always straightforward and that leaders are doing their best to protect the population. 
        Any potential change of leadership process would introduce another challenge to an already burdened government. 
        Additionally, during a crisis, people may be more willing to comply with the measures implemented by the government as 
        they understand that such measures are necessary to protect public health and safety. As a result, we often see an increase 
        in support for the government during times of crisis. This is the case in the smaller countries in our study, where governments 
        saw an increase in support at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Have the COVID-19 pandemic and the decisions made by governments impacted people's views of politics and political 
            parties? Our analysis has shown that in some cases, the actions of governments did not align with the reactions 
            of their population, mainly regarding mobility reduction. We also identified different groups of countries based 
            on their response to the pandemic, which may be influenced by factors such as population size and the severity of
             the crisis. The pandemic also sparked an increased interest in politics as people sought to understand the decisions
              being made by their governments and how they would be affected. Additionally, we found that people tend to support
              their ruling political parties during times of crisis, as they look to their leaders for stability and guidance.
               Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on political opinions 
               and behaviours.

        <h3>Further Work</h3>
        <p>
            As the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered people's views and behaviours, it raises the question of whether these
             changes will persist in the long term. Will the population continue to align with political decisions, or will there
              be shifts in attitudes and actions as the crisis evolves and becomes resolved? Examining this question through a 
              study over a longer duration and through each wave of the pandemic could provide valuable insights into the ways 
              in which the population may respond to political decisions and events in the future. Understanding the lasting 
              effects of the pandemic on politics will be important for predicting and navigating the changing landscape of the
               political sphere.
